# TODO List for Fixing MEAN Stack Issues

- [x] Start MongoDB using Docker Compose
- [x] Run the Express server locally
- [x] Run the Angular client on a different port (4201)
- [x] Verify the application is running by checking logs or accessing the app
- [x] Thoroughly test all API endpoints (employees and departments)
- [x] Test Angular client UI (manual testing required due to browser tool disabled)
